      <p><em>Undergraduate at <strong>Rutgers-New Brunswick</strong></em></p>
      <p>I am a rising junior at Rutgers University, majoring in computer science, and I believe myself to be somewhat unconventional and creative in whatever I do. I find myself in a flow state whenever I encounter an exciting coding challenge. I see a
        healthy work environment as essentials; therefore I strive to create one for everyone. I have always loved working with others and therefore am a firm believer of teamwork. I always find tech and analyzing things quite fascinating, and I look
        forward to bring this enthusiasm as a big part of my career.</p></td>
